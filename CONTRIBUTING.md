<!-- Adapted from http://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/contributing/ -->
This is the file describing how to contribute to the Uganda Public Health Gateway.

# Short Links to Important Resources:

   docs: <!-- include links to the roadmap and handbook -->
   bugs: Use github issues
   comms: Use the [Sci-GaIA forum](http://discourse.sci-gaia.eu) to discuss the project.

# Testing

Include information on how to test the project, where the tests are located in your directories.

## Environment details:

<!-- how to set up your development environment. This might exist in the README.md depending on the project. If so, include a link. -->

## How to submit changes:

<!-- Describe the Pull Request protocol - are you doing code review on a specific branch, which tests have to pass, etc. You might also include what response they'll get back from the team on submission, or any caveats about the speed of response. -->

## How to report a bug:

### Templates:

<!-- describe the bug report template -->

### First bugs for Contributors:

<!-- Sometimes it is helpful to provide some guidelines for the types of bugs contributors should tackle (should they want to fix the bugs and not just submit them) -->

### How to request an "enhancement":

<!-- Enhancements are features that you might like to suggest to a project, but aren't necessarily bugs/problems with the existing code; there is a "label" for enhancments in Github's Issues (where you report bugs), so you can tag issues as "enhancement," and thereby allow contributors to prioritize issues/bugs reported to the project. -->

### Style Guide / Coding conventions


## Code of Conduct

<!-- You can make this part of CONTRIBUTING.md as Atom did to set the tone for contributions. You can also make this a separate Markdown file and link to it in CONTRIBUTING.md. You can also extend this section to link to your LICENSE.md or any details for project consumers on permissions and license details you have established for building on your work. -->

### Recognition model
<!-- provide a pre-emptive "thank you" for contributing and list any recognition contributors might receive for participating in your project. -->

### Who is involved?

<!-- Open Government's CONTRIBUTING.md has as a name/author, and it might be nice to have a more personal/friendly individual to attact to a project and reach out to with questions. You might list the core contributors and their preferred methods of contact here, or link to a humans.txt file in your root directory (same place as your CONTRIBUTING.md file), which lets people know who they are working. Here is an example of a humans.txt file. -->

## Where can I ask for help?

A nice extension to the previous section, with links to good comms channels for anyone with questions.
